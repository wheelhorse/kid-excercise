### 3. Key Technical Patterns Identified

**Smart Factory Pattern**: The core innovation that makes this system special
```python
# Automatic optimization selection
smart_factory = SmartEmbeddingFactory()  # Auto-detects CPU
bge_model = smart_factory.get_bge_model()  # Returns optimized implementation
```

**Service Facade Pattern**: Clean API despite complex internals
```python
# Simple interface for complex operations
search_service.search_candidates(job_description, **params)
search_service.initialize(force_sync=True)
```

**Hybrid Composition Pattern**: Elegant search result fusion
```python
# RRF combines dense + sparse results optimally
results = hybrid_search(query, dense_weight=0.7, sparse_weight=0.3)
```

## Learning and Insights

### Key Architectural Decisions

**Why BGE-Small over BGE-Large?**
- 512 vs 1024 dimensions reduces computational overhead significantly
- Memory footprint fits comfortably on CPU-only systems
- Quality difference minimal for bilingual resume search use case
- Faster inference enables sub-second search response times

**Why Smart Factory Pattern?**
- CPU optimization is critical for performance but varies by hardware
- Manual optimization selection too complex for users
- Automatic detection ensures optimal performance out-of-the-box
- Easy to extend with new optimization strategies

**Why Hybrid Search with RRF?**
- Dense embeddings capture semantic relationships (Python ‚Üî ËΩØ‰ª∂ÂºÄÂèë)
- Sparse embeddings preserve exact keyword matching (specific technologies)
- RRF provides better ranking than simple score combination
- Configurable weights allow tuning for different search scenarios

### Technical Challenges Solved

**Cross-Platform CPU Optimization**: 
- Hardware detection without external dependencies
- Graceful fallback for unsupported architectures
- Performance optimization transparent to application code

**Bilingual Text Processing**:
