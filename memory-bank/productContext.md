# Product Context: Resume Retrieval System

## Problem Statement

### The Challenge
Recruitment professionals face significant difficulties in efficiently finding the most relevant candidates from large resume databases. Traditional keyword-based search systems fail to capture semantic meaning and context, leading to:

- **Poor Match Quality**: Missing qualified candidates due to vocabulary mismatches
- **Time Inefficiency**: Manual screening of hundreds of irrelevant results
- **Language Barriers**: Difficulty handling mixed Chinese/English content effectively
- **Scale Problems**: Slow performance when searching through thousands of resumes
- **Context Loss**: Inability to understand job requirements beyond exact keyword matches

### Current Pain Points
1. **Semantic Gap**: "Python developer" vs "软件工程师" - same meaning, different words
2. **Performance Issues**: Traditional SQL queries too slow for large datasets
3. **Relevance Ranking**: No intelligent scoring of candidate fit
4. **Bilingual Challenges**: Chinese/English mixed content poorly handled
5. **Maintenance Overhead**: Manual database management and updates

## Solution Overview

### Our Approach: Hybrid Search Intelligence
We solve these problems through a sophisticated **hybrid search system** that combines:

**Dense Embeddings (BGE-M3)**: Captures semantic meaning and context
- Understands that "machine learning engineer" relates to "AI specialist"
- Handles synonyms and conceptual relationships
- Works across Chinese and English languages

**Sparse Embeddings (BM25)**: Preserves exact keyword matching
- Ensures important specific terms aren't missed
- Handles technical terminology and proper nouns
- Provides explainable relevance scoring

**Smart Fusion (RRF)**: Combines both approaches optimally
- Reciprocal Rank Fusion for balanced results
- Configurable weighting based on search needs
- Consistent top-100 candidate ranking

### Key Value Propositions

1. **Superior Relevance**: Find candidates you would miss with keyword search alone
2. **Speed**: Sub-second search through thousands of resumes
3. **Bilingual Excellence**: Seamless Chinese/English content handling
4. **Automatic Optimization**: CPU-specific performance tuning
5. **Easy Integration**: Works with existing MariaDB CATS database

## User Experience Design

### Primary Use Case: Interactive Candidate Search

**Actor**: Recruitment professional or hiring manager
**Goal**: Find top 100 candidates matching a job description
**Context**: Terminal-based interface for testing and validation

#### Typical Workflow:
```
1. System Initialization
   → python main.py --init
   → Syncs latest resume data from MariaDB
   → Optimizes for current CPU architecture

2. Job Description Input
   → Enter natural language job description
   → Optionally add specific requirements
   → Configure search parameters (dense/sparse weights)

3. Intelligent Search
   → Hybrid search processes semantic and keyword aspects
   → Returns ranked list of top 100 candidates
   → Shows relevance scores and ranking details

4. Result Review
   → Browse candidate list with key information
   → Drill down into specific candidate details
   → Access original resume content and contact info

5. Refinement (Optional)
   → Adjust search weights for different results
   → Try alternative phrasing or requirements
   → Export results for further processing
```

### User Interface Philosophy

**Terminal-First Design**: 
- Professional developers and technical recruiters prefer CLI tools
- Scriptable and automatable for integration into workflows
- Fast, direct access without GUI overhead
- Easy to run on servers and remote systems

**Progressive Disclosure**:
- Simple commands for basic operations
- Detailed options available for power users
- Clear status feedback and error messages
- Comprehensive help and examples

## How It Should Work

### Search Intelligence
```python
# Input: Natural language job description
"Senior Python developer with machine learning experience, 
 preferably with Django and cloud deployment knowledge"

# System Processing:
1. Text Analysis: Extracts key concepts and requirements
2. Dense Embedding: Captures semantic relationships
3. Sparse Embedding: Identifies critical keywords
4. Hybrid Search: Combines both approaches with RRF
5. Ranking: Returns top 100 candidates with relevance scores

# Output: Ranked candidate list with explanations
Rank 1: Zhang Wei (0.8945) - ML Engineer, Python+Django, AWS experience
Rank 2: Li Ming (0.8623) - Senior Dev, PyTorch+Flask, GCP deployment
...
```

### Data Synchronization Flow
```
MariaDB Changes → Incremental Detection → Smart Processing → Qdrant Update
                                     ↓
                              CPU-Optimized Embeddings
                                     ↓  
                              Automatic Index Refresh
```

### Performance Expectations
